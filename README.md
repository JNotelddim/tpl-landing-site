## Hosting

(as of September 25th, 2023)
1. Log into the Control Panel on `one.com`
2. Find the `File Manager`
3. Either edit the file contents in the file manager, or just upload a new version of the file entirely.
  - (For example, if you want to change some copy/wording on the landing page, you could edit the `index.html` directly,
    or you could upload an entirely new version of the `index.html` file which has the intended edits.

** Note,
There's nothing that keeps this GitHub repository synced with one.com's File Manager.
That's totally up to good maintainence and hygiene.
